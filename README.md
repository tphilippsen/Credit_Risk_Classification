# Credit_Risk_Classification

This linear regression model and confusion matrix was created for the purpose of determining if a loan will be a good loan or a high-risk loan.  The model determines, based on several features, if a loan falls into either the healthy loan or high-risk loan categories.  The model also creates a confusion matrix which determines the outcome of loand based on predictions and actual results using the training and testing features.  

Healthy Loans
* Pecision score of 100%
* Recall score of 99%
* F1 score of 99%
High-Risk Loans
* Precision score of 85%
* Recall score of 91%
* F1 Score of 88%

* Overall the model was 99% accurate reporting 18,765 loans as healthy and 619 as high-risk.


Overall the model did a decent job of determining whether a loan was going to perform.  The model produced an overall accuracy of 99%.  Due to high-risk loans being predicted at 88% the model could be tightened up to provide a better outcome.  The model would be sufficient to use as per the confusion matrix only 56 loans were determined to be false negatives, which is a less than 1%.
